I am an Associate Developer at [SAP Labs](https://www.sap.com/india/about/labs-india.html), Bangalore. I graduated (offline!) from the International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore ([IIITB](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/)) with an integrated mtech degree in computer science as part of the batch of 2022. I am extremely grateful to have finished my master's thesis under the supervision of Professor [Ashish Choudhury](https://sites.google.com/view/ashish-choudhury). 

I am interested, broadly, in cryptography, and specifically, in secure multi-party computation. What I love the most about research is the absurd assurance I feel when I get the wrong solution, and the complete lack of expectation I have when I finally get the right one. Seeing the final draft of a paper I have co authored is also a very special feeling.

At SAP Labs, I am in a customer facing role where I can see the global impact of what my team builds. I wish to get back to research and try to come up with solutions which have the potential to impact the way the world works.
